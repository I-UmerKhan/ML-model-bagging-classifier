# ML-model-bagging-classifier
I learned the concept of the bagging classifier and how to use it. Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, is used to reduce the variance of machine learning models by training multiple instances of the same model on different subsets of the training data. These subsets are created through random sampling with replacement. The predictions from each model instance are then combined, typically through averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification), to produce a final prediction. This approach is particularly useful for high-variance models, such as decision trees, as it improves stability and accuracy by mitigating overfitting and capturing diverse patterns in the data.
